Earlier we saw how to <a href="/add-github-actions-to-graphics-toolkit-color">Add GitHub Actions (CI) to a Perl module</a> that is using Dist::Zilla.
This time I tried to do it another distribution found on <a href="https://cpan-digger.perlmaven.com/">CPAN::Digger</a>.

I found out that the command I used to install the dependencies did not install several modules needed for testing.

I am not 100% sure that I used the proper command, so I opened <a href="https://github.com/PerlServices/Dist-Zilla-PERLSRVDE/issues/2">a ticket reporting the issue</a>
and added an extra command to the GitHub Action configuration file to install the missing dependencies. See the <a href="https://github.com/PerlServices/Dist-Zilla-PERLSRVDE/pull/3">Pull-Request</a>

The authors of the package will be able to decide if I used the command incorrectly, if they might need to add the test-modules to the Dist::Zilla configuration,
or if the current solution is fine for them.

The extra line is

<code>
cpanm Test::BOM Test::NoTabs Test::Pod::Coverage Test::Pod Pod::Coverage::TrustPod
</code>

I've included the whole configuration file here for reference
