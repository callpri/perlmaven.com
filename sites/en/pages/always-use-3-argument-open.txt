=abstract start

Always use <hl>open my $fh, '<:encoding(utf8)', $filename or die ...</hl>, the 3-argument version of <hl>open</hl>,
and <a href="/open-files-in-the-old-way">never the old way</a>.

=abstract end

Note the <a href="/open-and-read-from-files">open</a> call has 3 parameters:

<ol>
  <li>The holder of the file-handle which has been just created.  <hl>open</hl> will assign the file-handle to it.</li>
  <li>The mode of open. (to read, to write,  to append, etc.)</li>
  <li>Supply the encoding (utf8 in our case).</li>
  <li>Path to the file.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Comment to the experts</h2>

In the rare cases when you must use the old version, you'll know it.
