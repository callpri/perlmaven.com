There are several modules on CPAN that help your <a href="/read-an-excel-file-in-perl">read an Excel file</a>.
In this article we'll look at handling dates that are in Excel files.

=abstract end

We have an Excel file called <a href="/files/dates.xls">dates.xls</a> that if you open you will see this:

<img src="/img/dates.png">

The file itself was created using Open Office running on Mac OSX, so it might not be 100% the format a real MS Excel
would create, but I hope this won't change the results. In any case, a lot can depend on the exact version of Excel file
format, so you might need to tweak the code to fit your files.


<h2>Requirements Installation</h2>

If you run the code and get an error that starts like this:

<code>
Can't locate Spreadsheet/Read.pm in @INC (you may need to install the Spreadsheet::Read module) (@INC contains:
</code>

then you need to install <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Spreadsheet::Read">Spreadsheet::Read</a>.


If you get an error like this:

<code>
Parser for XLS is not installed at
</code>

then you also need to install <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Spreadsheet-ParseXLSX">Spreadsheet-ParseXLSX</a>
though <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Spreadsheet-ParseExcel">Spreadsheet-ParseExcel</a> might be enough.
It depends on the version of your Excel file.

<h2>Spreadsheet::Read</h2>

In the first example we use  Spreadsheet::Read that makes the code reading the values very simple:

<include file="examples/read_excel_dates.pl">

The output when using this script with the above Excel file:

<code>
A1: 05/14/48
A2: 05/14/1948
A3: Friday, May 14, 1948
A4: 14.05.1948
</code>

<h2>Spreadsheet::ParseExcel</h2>

In the second example we used Spreadsheet::ParseExcel for a more detailed reading.

<include file="examples/parse_excel_dates.pl">

The output when using this script with the above Excel file:

<code>
A1: 05/14/48
A2: 05/14/1948
A3: Friday, May 14, 1948
A4: 14.05.1948

A1: 17667
A2: 17667
A3: 17667
A4: 14.05.1948

--- Use the date from a cell ---
1899-12-30
1948-05-14
</code>
