When looking at the <a href="https://metacpan.org/recent">recent uploads to CPAN</a> I bumped into the <a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/Math-Polynomial-Chebyshev">Math-Polynomial-Chebyshev</a>
and noticed it does not have any CI system enabled. So I guess I could contribute to this package a bit by adding GitHub Actions to it.

<screencast file="enable-github-actions-on-chebyshev.mp4" youtube="dULcU-uEWEw" />

I cloned the GitHub repository to my computer:

<code>
git clone git@github.com:pjacklam/p5-Math-Polynomial-Chebyshev.git
</code>

Ran the tests locally:

<code>
cpanm --installdeps .
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
</code>

Created a branch

<code>
git checkout -b ci
</code>

Copied the perl.yml file from the <a href="https://github.com/szabgab/try-github-actions/">try-github-actions</a> repository.

I saved a copy of the file here so even if the file changes in the future you'll be able to find the original copy:

<include file="examples/chebyshev-ci.yml">

Then had to fork the original repository on GitHub so I will be able to push out my changes.

<code>
git remote add fork git@github.com:szabgab/p5-Math-Polynomial-Chebyshev.git
git remote -v
</code>


Then pushed it out the changes to my repository.

<code>
git push --set-upstream fork ci
</code>

Chyecked the <b>Actions</b> tab to see if everything works fine.

Finally I sent a pull-request asking the author to accept these changes.
