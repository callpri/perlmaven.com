After reading and answering e-mails I usually store them in a
hierarchy of mbox-es. Unfortunately finding something there is quite difficult.
I have tons of messages and sometimes I file messages under the sender, sometimes under the topic,
and I am sure there are also cases, probably lots of them, when I make a mistake and file a messaging in the wrong
mbox.

So I decided I'll write a small application to index all the e-mails, put the data in a Mongo database and write
a client to search among the messages. Let's start by processing the mailboxes.

=abstract end

There are probably other distribution on CPAN that can handle this job, but I found <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Email::Folder">Email::Folder</a>,
currently maintained by RJBS. Let's give it a try.

<h2>Traversing the directory tree</h2>

Even before I do that I need a way to go over all the files. For  this
I used <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Path::Iterator::Rule">Path::Iterator::Rule</a> that I have already <a href="/finding-files-in-a-directory-using-perl">used</a>.

<include file="examples/traversing_directory_tree.pl">

I run this using <hl>time</hl> so I can see how long it takes:

<code>
$ time perl bin/mboxer.pl /home/gabor/mail/
real  0m0.119s
user  0m0.065s
sys   0m0.032s
</code>

I did not have to wait for that.

<h2>Going over the messages</h2>

The next step is to load each file using <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Email::Folder">Email::Folder</a>.
Before I go into really processing the data, let's see how long does this take.

Inside the <hl>while</hl> I added the following code: to open the email-folder
and just go through all the messages:

<code lang="perl">
    my $folder = Email::Folder->new($file);
    while (my $msg = $folder->next_message) {  # Email::Simple objects
    }
</code>

<include file="examples/traversing_messages.pl">

I ran this again with <hl>time</hl> and it took almost 2 minutes. I even added a counter to see how many messages I have.
There are 119,026 messages in my folders. Clearly I can't just write a script to search things in these folders.
I'll need to index them and then search on those indexes.

<code>
$ time bin/mboxer.pl /home/gabor/mail/

119026

real  1m45.088s
user  1m11.283s
sys   0m1.501s
</code>

<h2>Processing the headers</h2>

In most cases I'd like to search based on some of the header fields - not so much on the content of the mail.
Well, OK, I guess searching on the body will be very important, but that's a lot of data. Let's try to do something
with the header. But what headers are there? Surely there is a header called <hl>From</hl>. Let's see how can I fetch that?

I added the following line to the internal <hl>while-loop</hl>:

<code lang="perl">
say $msg->header('From');
</code>

Running this would take another 2 minutes and after a few tens of addresses I am sure the same format would be repeated.
So I add a counter that after 20 entries will call exit.

<code lang="perl">
say $msg->header('From');
exit if $main::cnt++ > 20;
</code>

I know I could have used the <hl>$counter</hl> I added to the code previously, but when I ran this experiment first
I did not have that counter yet. Besides, I find this counter a neat trick.

Instead of declaring a lexical variable I access a package variable in the <hl>main</hl> namespace.
<hl>use strict</hl> disregards such variable when accessed with a fully qualified package name.

(If you recall the error you would get if you wanted to use a variable without declaring it with <hl>my</hl>
say <a href="/global-symbol-requires-explicit-package-name">Global symbol requires explicit package name</a>.
With <hl>$main::cnt</hl> we provided that explicit package name.)

In addition <hl>use warnings</hl> does not complain when we call <hl>++</hl> on a variable that was <hl>undef</hl>.
So this code can be used with additional ceremony.

The results had 3 different types of address:

<code>
Foo Bar <foo@bar.com>
"Foo Bar" <Foo@Bar.com>
=?ISO-8859-1?Q?Foo_B=F6r?= <foo@bar.com>
</code>

I'll have to unify them before inserting into the database.

<h2>What headers are there?</h2>

Another thing that I wanted to know is what kind of header are there?  
The <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Email::Simple">Email::Simple</a> object we got back from
<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Email::Folder">Email::Folder</a> has a <hl>headers</hl> method that will
return the list of header names. Such as <hl>From</hl>.

I replaced the <hl>say $msg->header('From');</hl> line with a loop to go over the header names
and print them:

<code lang="perl">
    foreach my $h ($msg->headers) {
        say $h;
    }
</code>

Of course I got the same headers a lot of times, so I decided I'll collect the headers
in a hash, and at the same time I'll also count how many times each header appears.

<code lang="perl">
        foreach my $h ($msg->headers) {
            $main::count{$h}++;
        }
</code>

At the end I put:

<code lang="perl">
foreach my $k (sort keys %main::count) {
    say "$k  $main::count{$k}";
}
</code>


and after the internal <hl>while</hl> loop I added a call to <hl>last</hl>. That way
the process will stop just after the first file.

Even with that I got a <b>lot</b> of headers. Some of them only differ in case:

I think that's enough for the first step. I'll probably have to pick some of the most important header
fields and start with those.

Probably: From, To, Date, CC (and Cc), Subject.
