I am trying to connect to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMTPS">SMTPS</a> using <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Net::SMTP::SSL">Net::SMTP::SSL</a> library.
While trying to connect I am getting an error which says.

<code>
IO::Socket::INET configuration failederror:00000000:lib(0):func(0):reason(0)
</code>

I am able to connect to SMTP. I have tried the same with telnet and telnets which was successful.
Can anyone please give me some ideas about this error?

(Problem was fixed with <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/IO::Socket::SSL">IO::Socket::SSL</a> version 1.06.)

<h2>Are you sure you talk to an SMTP server which talks SSL directly?</h2>

There are two ways to do SSL within SMTP, one is to just tunnel SMTP within an SSL connection (this is what Net::SMTP::SSL supports)
and the other is to have a normal SMTP server (usually sitting at port 25), start a unencrypted session and then switch with
STARTTLS command to an SSL session. This is unsupported by Net::SMTP::SSL.

If you are sure that you try to use Net::SMTP::SSL in the intended way (tunnel SMTP through SSL instead STARTTLS on plain connection)
you could post an example program which shows your problem (please with the real server) so I could have a look at it.

I have the exact same issue here's my test program:

<code lang="perl">
use Net::SMTP::SSL;

$IO::Socket::SSL::DEBUG = 1;

my $smtp = Net::SMTP::SSL->new( 'SMTP',
Host => "mail.peakpeak.com",
Debug => 1,
Port => '465');

if(defined $smtp)
{
        print "'$smtp'\n";
} else {

        die "SMTP is undefined\n$@$!";

}

$smtp->quit;
</code>

Here's the output of this program:

<code>
CA file certs/my-ca.pem not found, using CA path instead.
IO::Socket::INET configuration failederror:00000000:lib(0):func(0):reason(0)
 at test.pl line 5
SMTP is undefined
Net::SMTP::SSL: Bad service '' at test.pl line 15.
</code>


Also some additional information: I get the same exact error when I have the initial call as:

<code lang="perl">
my $smtp = Net::SMTP::SSL->new(
Host => "mail.peakpeak.com",
Debug => 1,
Port => '465');
</code>

or

<code lang="perl">
my $smtp = Net::SMTP::SSL->new("mail.peakpeak.com",
Debug => 1,
Port => '465');
</code>

And I have another perl program on the same machine (In the same directory even) that uses
IO::Socket::SSL to make https requests (Via LWP::UserAgent), which works perfectly. I'm not actually sure this is an issue
directly related to IO::Socket::SSL and not Net::SMTP or Net::SMTP::SSL (Although the latter simply substitutes IO::Socket::SSL for IO::Socket::INET in the former)

Problem is fixed with <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/IO::Socket::SSL">IO::Socket::SSL</a> version 1.06 which I just uploaded to CPAN.

Problem was, that IO::Socket::SSL "sanitized" the Arguments it gets by setting undef stuff to ''.
This way it gave a LocalPort of '' to IO::Socket::INET which did not like it.
This was probably broken long long ago.
