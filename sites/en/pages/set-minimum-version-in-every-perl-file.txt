After <a href="/fix-perl-critic-test-failures-reported-by-cpantesters">hiding the Perl Critic issues reported by the CPAN Testers</a>
I wanted to check what were those?

One of them was <a href="/private-member-data-shouldnt-be-accessed-directly">Private Member Data shouldn't be accessed directly</a>
and the other one <a href="/three-argument-form-of-open-used-and-it-is-not-available-until">Three-argument form of open used and it is not available until perl 5.6.</a>

The second policy lead me to the <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Perl::Critic::Policy::Compatibility::PerlMinimumVersionAndWhy">Compatibility::PerlMinimumVersionAndWhy</a>
policy which seemed to be useful. It analyzes the source code and reports features that are only available in recent versions of perl.
For example the <a href="/what-is-new-in-perl-5.10--say-defined-or-state">defined-or (<hl>//</hl>)</a> appeared in perl 5.10.

The policy requires us to explicitly state the minimal version of perl in each one of our files.

=abstract end

I know, I've <a href="/use-strict-use-warnings-no-diagnostics">removed the use use 5.005 statement</a> earlier
and now I am adding similar use-statements. I am not really convinced that adding the minimum version to
every file is that useful, but that allows me to use this policy.

The question:

<h2>How to use the Compatibility::PerlMinimumVersionAndWhy policy?</h2>

After installing the <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Perl-Critic-Pulp">Perl-Critic-Pulp</a> distribution I could run:

<code>
perlcritic --single-policy Compatibility::PerlMinimumVersionAndWhy .
</code>

that generated quite a few lines, but all of them were versions of these lines:

<code>
[Compatibility::PerlMinimumVersionAndWhy] _perl_5006_pragmas requires 5.006 at line 2, column 1.
[Compatibility::PerlMinimumVersionAndWhy] _Pulp__for_loop_variable_using_my requires 5.004 at line 13, column 1.
[Compatibility::PerlMinimumVersionAndWhy] _Pulp__open_my_filehandle requires 5.006 at line 52, column 2.
[Compatibility::PerlMinimumVersionAndWhy] _three_argument_open requires 5.006 at line 52, column 2.
</code>

That means adding <hl>use 5.006;</hl> to all the files will silence this policy, but before we do that, let's see how
can we convince <hl>perlcritic</hl> to use this policy.

In the <hl>.perlcriticrc</hl> file we need to enable the <hl>compatibility</hl> theme as well:

<code>
theme = core + compatibility
</code>

That's not enough because the severity level of this specific policy was quite low. I think it was 2.
We had to tell perlcritic to use a higher severity:

<code>
[Compatibility::PerlMinimumVersionAndWhy]
severity = 5
</code>

that's fine, and now <hl>perlcritic .</hl> already started to report the validations,
but now it also reported about other violations. I had to turn the one I found off:

<code>
[-Compatibility::ProhibitThreeArgumentOpen]
</code>

Lastly, in order to get Travis-CI run these tests too I had to add

<code>
  - cpanm --notest Perl::Critic::Policy::Compatibility::PerlMinimumVersionAndWhy
</code>

to the <hl>.travis.yml</hl> file which I've actually failed at first, hence I had
to make a second commit fixing <hl>.travis.yml</hl>.
