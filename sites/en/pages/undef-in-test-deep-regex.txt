<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::Deep">Test::Deep</a> is a great module if you need to test deep and/or fuzzy data structures,
but sometimes it does not give the correct error messages. Recently I've encountered such a case when I got tons of warnings like this:

<b>Use of uninitialized value $got in pattern match (m//) at Test/Deep/Regexp.pm line 57.</b>

Unfortunately the warning did not say what really caused it, but after patching the Test::Deep::Regexp I could solve the riddle.

=abstract end

The problem was that in my test I had something like this:


<code lang="perl">
cmp_deeply \@data, array_each({
    fname => re('^.*$'),
    lname => re('^.*$'),
    ...
    email => re('^.*$'),
    address => re('^.*$')
});
</code>

with about 25 fields, each one with its own regex.

Getting a warning that one of them is undef was not really useful.

The source code of Test/Deep/Regexp.pm looked like this:

<code lang="perl">
sub descend
{
        my $self = shift;
        my $got = shift;

        my $re = $self->{val};
        if (my $match_exp = $self->{matches})
        {
                my $flags = $self->{flags};
                my @match_got;
                if ($flags eq "g")
                {
                        @match_got = $got =~ /$re/g;
                }
                else
                {
                        @match_got = $got =~ /$re/;
                }
 
                if (@match_got)
                {
                        return Test::Deep::descend(\@match_got, $match_exp);
                }
                else
                {
                        return 0;
                }
        }
        else
        {
                return ($got =~ $re) ? 1 : 0;
        }
}
</code>

Line 57 in the original code, that generated the warning was this line: <hl>return ($got =~ $re) ? 1 : 0;</hl>.

A quick glance at the return value gave me the impression that this would indicate the success or failure of the regex.

So I changed the code and added

<hl>return 0 if not defined $got;</hl> right after copying the second parameter to the <hl>$got</hl> variable on the 2nd row of the function.
So I had


<code lang="perl">
sub descend
{
        my $self = shift;
        my $got = shift;
        return 0 if not defined $got;
...
</code>

Then I ran my tests again. This time the test failed and told me exactly which key in my hash was <hl>undef</hl>.

At this point I had two choices:

If having and <hl>undef</hl> there was incorrect then I'd need to fix my code, or if the <hl>undef</hl> was acceptable
I could change my test to be:

<code lang="perl">
     field => any(undef, re('...')),
</code>

with the appropriate regex. This expression will only try to run the regex if the value is not <hl>undef</hl>.

The following script can demonstrate the issue:

I have even opened a <a href="https://github.com/rjbs/Test-Deep/issues/39">ticket</a> with this issue, but I am not sure if
my recommended solution is acceptable at all. In any case this little change helped me figuring out the source of the warnings.
