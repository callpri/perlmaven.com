Why should I always <b>use strict</b>?

It is simple. It can save you a lot of time and headache.

=abstract end

<hl>use strict;</hl> is basically a compiler flag that tells the Perl compiler to change its behaviour in 3 important ways.

You can turn on and off the three areas separately, but if you just write <hl>use strict;</hl> at the top of each perl file
(both scripts and modules), then you turn on all 3 of them.

<h2>The 3 parts of use strict</h2>

<hl>use strict 'vars';</hl> generates a compile-time error if you access a
<a href="/variable-declaration-in-perl">variable without declaration</a>.

<hl>use strict 'refs';</hl> generates a runtime error if you use
<a href="/symbolic-reference-in-perl">symbolic references</a>.

<hl>use strict 'subs';</hl> compile-time error if you try to use a
<a href="/barewords-in-perl">bareword identifier</a> in an improper way.


<h2>Turning off strict</h2>

While in general it is a good thing to have <hl>strict</hl> in effect in all the code,
there are cases when we would like to use the extra magic power we can have without 
<hl>strict</hl>. For such cases we would like to be able to turn it off.

Once you turned on with <hl>use strict;</hl>, you can selectively turn off some,
or all of the 3 parts in a lexical scope. That is, you can turn off parts of the
strictness within a pair of curly braces <hl>{}</hl>.

<code lang="perl">
use strict;

if (...) {
   no strict 'refs';
   # do you trick here...
}
</code>

For examples, see the three articles above.

<h2>hidden strict</h2>

There are a number of modules that if you <hl>use</hl> them in a file, it will 
automatically and implicitly turn <hl>use strict</hl> on in that specific file.

Among the modules are <a href="/moose">Moose</a>,
<a href="/moo">Moo</a>, <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Dancer">Dancer</a>,
and <a href="/mojolicious">Mojolicious</a>, but there are more.

There is a <a href="https://github.com/szabgab/Test-Strict/blob/master/lib/Test/Strict.pm#L242">
list of such modules</a> in the source of <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::Strict">Test::Strict</a>.
If you find more such modules, please open a ticket for Test::Strict, or send a pull-request with the fix.

<h2>Perl 5.12 and newer</h2>

If a file requires perl 5.12 or later (eg. by having <hl>use 5.012;</hl> or <hl>use 5.12.0;</hl> in the code),
this too implicitly load <hl>use strict;</hl>.

So when you read code, or when you copy examples, please make sure you notice the implicit use of strict.
