=abstract start

Once in a while I see people calling subroutines in perl like this:

<code>
&some_sub($param);
</code>

That <hl>&amp;</hl> character at the beginning should not be there.

=abstract end

Instead of repeating the explanation let me just point you to the article by Dave Cross:

<a href="http://perlhacks.com/2015/04/subroutines-and-ampersands/">Subroutines and Ampersands</a>

The only place where you need to put &amp; in-front of the subroutine name is when you take a refernce to it:

<code>
my $ref = \&some_sub;
</code>
