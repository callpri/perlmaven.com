To check if string is empty use <hl>eq</hl>. To check if it has only spaces
or only white space in it, use a regex.


=abstract end

<h2>Is the string empty?</h2>

<code lang="perl">
if ($str eq '') {
    print "String is empty.";
}
</code>

That would work, but if <hl>use warnings;</hl> is in effect, as it should be,
then you might get a <a href="/use-of-uninitialized-value">Use of uninitialized value</a> warnings if <hl>$str</hl> is <a href="/undef-and-defined-in-perl">undef</a>. So it might
be better to check this too, before any other comparison:

<code lang="perl">
if (not defined $str) {
    print "String is so empty, it is not even defined.";
}
</code>

and to do the other comparisons only if <hl>$str</hl> is defined.


<h2>Has the string only spaces in it?</h2>

<code lang="perl">
if ($str =~ /^ *$/) {
    print "String contains 0 or more spaces and nothing else.";
}
</code>

<h2>Has the string only white-spaces in it?</h2>

<code lang="perl">
if ($str =~ /^\s*$/) {
    print "String contains 0 or more white-space character and nothing else.";
}
</code>

A white-space character can be a space, a tab, and a few other characters that
normally we cannot see. The <hl>>^</hl> at the beginning of the regex means
"match at the beginning of the string".
The <hl>$</hl> at the end of the regex means "match at the end of the string".

<hl>*</hl> in the regex is a quantifier. It means match 0 or more times the thing
that is on its left hand side. In the previous regex there was a space in on the left hand side
of the <hl>*</hl>. In the second regex we have <hl>\s</hl> in front of the
<hl>*</hl>

\s matches any on of the following 5 characters:

<ul>
<li>space</li>
<li>tab (<hl>\t</hl>)</li>
<li>carriage-return (<hl>\r</hl>)</li>
<li>newline (<hl>\n</hl>)</li>
<li>form-feed (<hl>\f</hl)</li>
</ul>
