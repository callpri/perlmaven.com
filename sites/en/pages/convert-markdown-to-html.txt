I have lots of documents written in Markdown format and I was looking for a way to convert them to HTML.

=abstract end

First I tried the <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Text::Markdown">Text::Markdown</a> module, it seemed like the obvious pick. Onfortunately it did not handle
tables.

Then I found <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Text::MultiMarkdown">Text::MultiMarkdown</a> and that worked as I expected.
