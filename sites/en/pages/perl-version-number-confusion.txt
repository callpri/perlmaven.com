<a href="http://www.dagolden.com/index.php/369/version-numbers-should-be-boring/">Version numbers should be boring</a>
and modules such as <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/version">version</a>
and <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Perl::Version">Perl::Version</a> should be boring too.

Yet they are confusing me.

And the output

<code>
Perl::Version: 1.013
version:       0.9912
----
5.11
v5.11
5.011
5.11
----
v5.11
5.011
5.11
5.11
</code>

I am not yet sure which module is confused, but I am, for sure.


It seems that <hl>Perl::Version</hl> thinks that <hl>5.11</hl> and <hl>v5.11</hl> are the same
while <hl>version</hl> thinks they are different.

Not only that, but Perl::Version seems to thin <hl>5.11</hl> equals to <hl>5.011</hl>.
I am fairly sure that should not be the case.
