Earlier we saw how to <a href="/cpan-digger-and-hacktoberfest">use CPAN::Digger to find a Perl project to contribute to</a>.
This time we used <a href="https://cpan-digger.perlmaven.com/">CPAN::Digger</a> and found the <a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/Graphics-Toolkit-Color">Graphics-Toolkit-Color</a>
project to which we added a GitHub Actions configuration file to enable Continuous Integration (CI) executing the tests of the module on every push.

=abstract end

I created a fork of the GitHub repository and in a branch I added the following file to be <b>./github/workflows/ci.yml</b>.
(copied from the <a href="https://github.com/szabgab/try-github-actions/">try-github-actions</a> repository.
Once the changes were pushed out the instructions started to run on the servers of GitHub.
When I saw the tests passed I could send the Pull-Request.
