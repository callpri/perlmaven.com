=abstract start

When searching in CPAN, I prefer to use <a href="http://metacpan.org/">MetaCPAN</a> over search.cpan.org because it looks better, and because it is open source.
If there is a bug that really bothers me, I can send a patch. If I want to add a feature, I can do that. If is accepted by the developers, then everyone will benefit
from it, but I could even run a private instance of MetaCPAN.

Nevertheless, there are many cases when I use Google or <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> when looking for a solution.
In many cases they will provide a link to search.cpan.org. Almost never to MetaCPAN.

Given that link, how can we easily jump to the respective page on MetaCPAN?

<h2>It's easy</h2>

If after searching Google or DuckDuckGo, you reach a URL on search.cpan.org,
something like <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~capttofu/DBD-mysql-4.027/lib/DBD/mysql.pm">this</a>,
you can add the letter <b>m</b> in-front of the word cpan in the URL to have <a href="http://search.mcpan.org/~capttofu/DBD-mysql-4.027/lib/DBD/mysql.pm">this link</a>
that will redirect you to the respective page on MetaCPAN.

This is the change you need to make in the URL:

<pre>
http://search.cpan.org/~capttofu/DBD-mysql-4.027/lib/DBD/mysql.pm
http://search.mcpan.org/~capttofu/DBD-mysql-4.027/lib/DBD/mysql.pm
             ^^^
</pre>


I did not remember this, but apparently Dave Cross <a href="http://perlhacks.com/2013/01/give-me-metacpan/">wrote about this already</a>,
and even showed a Firefox plugin that will do this automatically for you.
