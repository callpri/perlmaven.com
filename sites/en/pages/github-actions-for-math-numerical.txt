=abstract start

Starting at <a href="https://cpan-digger.perlmaven.com/">CPAN::Digger</a> I found the <a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/Math-Numerical">Math::Numerical</a> distribution
without any Continuous Integration configured.

=abstract end

Adding GitHub Actions to this project was quite straigh forward except for two things:

<h2>Adding prerequisites</h2>

I had to manually install some prerequsites that were needed for the tests:

<code>
    - name: Install Modules
      run: |
        cpanm -v
        cpanm --installdeps --notest .
        cpanm --notest Test2::V0
        cpanm --notest Test2::Tools::PerlCritic
        cpanm --notest Test::Pod
        cpanm --notest IPC::Run3
        cpanm --notest Readonly
</code>

This has been bothering me for some time now so I asked both on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/y13dgb/cpanm_installing_testdependencies/">Reddit</a> and
on <a href="https://perlmonks.org/?node_id=11147339">PerlMonks</a>.

<h2>Disable Windows</h2>

I think at the time I was doing this there was some problem with the Windows infrastructure of GitHub Actions or the Perl
that was supposed to be installed on Windows so I had to disable the Windows runner.
The author of the module can later enable it to see if the isses were fixed already.

<h2>Speed</h2>

It took 9-10 minutes to run the job on OSX.  (5 min on Ubuntu Linux) The main time consuming part is the installation of the test prerequisites.
I added the <b>--notest</b> flag to the <b>cpanm</b> commands that reduced the run-time to 2 minutes.

<h2>Full configuration file</h2>
