If you get a <a href="/common-warnings-and-error-messages">warning or error from Perl</a> that you don't understand you have several choices:

<ul>
  <li>Ask for <a href="/help">help</a> in one of the channels mentioned <a href="/help">here</a></li>
  <li>Check out the alternative, and hopefully <a href="/common-warnings-and-error-messages">beginner friendly explanations</a> on the Perl Maven site.</li>
  <li>Turn on <b>diagnostics</b> or use <b>splain</b>.</li>
</ul>

=abstract end

Beyond the short error message or warning you get from perl, you can also ask perl to provide you a long
explanation. You can do this either by adding <hl>use diagnostics;</hl> to your code (recommended only during development),
or by saving the error message in a file and then using <hl>splain</hl>.

<h2>Illegal division by zero</h2>

Let's use a trivial example:

<code lang="perl">
$x = 0;
print 1 / $x;
</code>

If we have the above code (though you should <a href="/strict">always use strict and warnings too</a>) in a file called <hl>x.pl</hl>
and we run it using <hl>perl x.pl</hl> we get the error:

<code>
Illegal division by zero at x.pl line 2.
</code>

I know. This error is probably obvious to most people familiar with basic math and when you encounter such error, the main issue is
probably how did 0 end up in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denominator">denominator</a>, in our case in <hl>$x</hl>?

Nevertheless it is a good example to show how to get more detailed explanation:

<h2>use diagnostics</h2>

Add <hl>use diagnostics</hl> to the code:

<code lang="perl">
use diagnostics;

$x = 0;
print 1 / $x;
</code>

run as <hl>perl x.pl</hl>

The output looks like this:

<code>
Illegal division by zero at x.pl line 4 (#1)
    (F) You tried to divide a number by 0.  Either something was wrong in
    your logic, or you need to put a conditional in to guard against
    meaningless input.

Uncaught exception from user code:
    Illegal division by zero at x.pl line 4.
</code>


<h2>splain</h2>

Splain is a command-line tool that comes with the standard installation of Perl.

We run the original script (without adding <hl>use diagnostics</hl> but we redirect the standard error to a file:

<code>
perl x.pl 2> x.err
</code>

The we run:

<code>
splain x.err
</code>

It will print

<code>
Illegal division by zero at x.pl line 2 (#1)
    (F) You tried to divide a number by 0.  Either something was wrong in
    your logic, or you need to put a conditional in to guard against
    meaningless input.
</code>


<h2>splain in a pipe</h2>

The more adventurous Linux/Unix user can also pipe the error message through splain without saving it in a file using

<code>
perl x.pl 2>&1 | splain
</code>
