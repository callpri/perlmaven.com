<h2>Notes</h2>

Dave works at the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla project</a> that was created when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape">Netscape</a>
released the source code of their browser.

He is the project leader of the <a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/">Bugzilla</a> project, which is one of the most well-known
Open source Perl projects. (BTW it was originally written in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcl">Tcl</a>.)

You can follow <a href="https://twitter.com/justdavemiller">Dave Miller</a> and the <a href="https://twitter.com/justdavemiller">Bugzilla</a> project on Twitter.

<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/os/">Firefox OS</a> is one of the recent projects developed at the Mozilla Foundation.
The Mozilla Foundation has thousands of servers Dave helps to maintain. Most of them are used to handle the traffic of
the <a href="https://marketplace.firefox.com/">Firefox marketplace</a> and the
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/mobile/sync/">Firefox sync</a> services.
They also have a large build-farm used to build their various products on a large number of diverse platforms.
They use <a href="http://buildbot.net/">Buildbot</a> to manage the builds.

Bugzilla uses <a href="https://bzr.mozilla.org/bugzilla">Bazaar</a> for version control.
Check out the <a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/developers/">resources for developers</a> for more information
on how to get involved.

Both assistant project managers <a href="http://max.kanat.us/">Max Kanat-Alexander</a>,
and <a href="http://lpsolit.wordpress.com/">Frédéric Buclin</a> (LpSolit) have recently
left the project that left a void in the project.

In the last <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla:Meetings:2013-07-17">Bugzilla developer meeting</a>,
two people: <a href="http://globau.wordpress.com/">Byron Jones</a> (glob on IRC) and
<a href="https://twitter.com/simongreen_net">Simon Green</a> have
stepped up for the patch approval process which is necessary
to accept patches from every developer. You can watch the entire meeting on <a href="http://youtu.be/vxVGhaPFaZc">YouTube</a>.

The main communication channel for the Bugzilla developers is IRC: <a href="irc://irc.mozilla.org/bugzilla">#bugzilla on irc.mozilla.org</a>.
You can access it via <a href="http://landfill.bugzilla.org/irc/"> Bugzilla IRC Gateway</a> without installing anything.
All the <a href="http://logbot.glob.com.au/?c=bugzilla">history of the Bugzilla IRC channel</a> is also available.

The <a href="http://bzr.mozilla.org/bugzilla/trunk/annotate/head:/Bugzilla/Install/Requirements.pm">list of Perl Modules</a>
used by Bugzilla can be seen in the source code of the installer.

Some of the areas where contributions is needed are:

<ul>
  <li>Writing documentation</li>
  <li>Testing</li>
  <li>Improve the User Interface, or even crate mobile web interfaces</li>
</ul>
