Earlier I've mentined that I don't like the fact that we used copy-paste in the test script and duplicate code.
Before we go on and add more test, let's refactor the test code.

=abstract end


I've created an array called <hl>@cases</hl> listing all the (2) test cases. We'll have more.

<code lang="perl">
my @cases = ('heading1', 'headers');
</code>

I've also changed the code processing the test cases to be in a loop and use the values
from the <hl>@cases</hl> array:

<code lang="perl">
for my $case (@cases) {
    my $result = $m->parse_file("t/input/$case.md");
    is_deeply $result, decode_json( path("t/dom/$case.json")->slurp_utf8 );
}
</code>

Finally, though in the code it is earlier, I've updated the <hl>plan</hl> to be based
on the number of entries in the <hl>@cases</hl> array.


The previous test file is here:

<include file="examples/markua-parser/c580d63/t/01-test.t">

The new test file is here:

<include file="examples/markua-parser/79d9bfe/t/01-test.t">

We can then record our changes in git:

<code>
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "refactor test code"
$ git push
</code>
