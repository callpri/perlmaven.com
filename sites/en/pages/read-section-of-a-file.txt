I was working on an example script that used a lot of calls to <hl>seek</hl>, but I kept bumping into bugs. I thought it might be a
useful debugging tool to be able to read and print any section of a file given the location of the first byte and the number of bytes.

So here is a quick script I put together.

=abstract end

<screencast file="perl-read-section-of-a-file.mp4" youtube="S-cI2NxJPDE" />

<include file="examples/read_file_section.pl">

The <a href="/seek">seek</a> command allows you to move the file-reading pointer back and forth in a file so you will be abel to read the file
in an arbitrary order. The <hl>Fcntl</hl> module provides various constants to help you. Using the SEEK_SET constant will tell the
<hl>seek</hl> command to start from the beginning of the file.

The <hl>read</hl> command allows us to read an arbitrary number of bytes from a file into a variable that people usually call a "buffer"
so we used the variable name <hl>$buffer</hl> for it.

This is a sample data file:

<include file="examples/data/planets.txt">


<code>
$ perl examples/read_file_section.pl examples/data/planets.txt 48 5
'Pluto'

$ perl examples/read_file_section.pl examples/data/planets.txt 48 6
'Pluto
'
</code>
