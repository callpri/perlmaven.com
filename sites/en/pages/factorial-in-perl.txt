I was working on some examples when I had to calculate <hl>factorial</hl>.  (<hl>n!</hl> in math)

=abstract end

The solution without any modules:

<code lang="perl">
use strict;
use warnings;
use 5.010;

my $f = 1;
my $i = 1;
my $n = 4;
$f *= ++$i while $i < $n;
say $f;
</code>


The solution when using the <hl>reduce</hl> function of the
standard <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/List::Util">List::Util</a> module:

<code lang="perl">
use List::Util qw(reduce);
my $fact = reduce { $a * $b } 1 .. $n;
say $fact;
</code>

<hl>reduce</hl> will take the first two values of the list on the right hand side, assign them to
<hl>$a</hl> and <hl>$b</hl> respectively, execute the block.

Then it will take the result, assign it to <hl>$a</hl> and take the next element from the list,
assign it to <hl>$b</hl> and execute the block. This step will be repeated till the end of the list.
